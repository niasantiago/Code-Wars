# Code-Wars 
# 1. Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition The binary number returned should be a string. Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation))) 
# 2. Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.  
# 3. Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.
# 4. Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it. 
# 5. It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters. 
# 7. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
