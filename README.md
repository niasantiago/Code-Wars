# Code-Wars 
# 1. Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition The binary number returned should be a string. Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation))
# 2. Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.  
# 3. Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.
# 4. Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it. 
# 5. It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters. 
# 7. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.  
# 8 Count the number of Duplicates Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits Example "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b' "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice `b` and `B` "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice "aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice  
# 9 Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order. 
# 10 Factorials are often used in probability and are used as an introductory problem for looping constructs. In this kata you will be summing together multiple factorials.

# 12 An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a constant difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of numbers. You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing term.You have to write a function that receives a list, list size will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the first or last one.
# 13 Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.
# 14 A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
# 15 In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.Our function will take three parameters:last - The Date object with the date of the last periodtoday - The Date object with the date of the checkcycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days.Return true if the number of days passed from last to today is greater than cycleLength. Otherwise, return false.
# 16 Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b. Note: a and b are not ordered!
# 17 Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
# 18 Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total. Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).
# 19 Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle" After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says: "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:
# 20 You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.
# 21 Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.
# 22 Given an array of integers.Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array. 
# 24 Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
# 25 In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
# 26 You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.
# 27 Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
# 28 Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.
# 29 Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0. 
# 30 Given a 2D ( nested ) list ( array, vector, .. ) of size m * n, your task is to find the sum of the minimum values in each row. So the function should return 26 because the sum of the minimums is 1 + 5 + 20 = 26. 
# 31 Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.
# 32 Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
# 33 It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script. Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.The array will never be empty.
